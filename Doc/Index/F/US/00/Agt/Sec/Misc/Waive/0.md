Note=Provisions regarding waiver of rights.  Generally, these state that rights are not waived.  The purpose of a Waiver section is to counteract arguments that tolerant acceptance of another party's shortcomings in one or a few instances is, effectively, a modification of the contract terms.  The first of these sections is our "recommended" clause, which is closely based on the ABA Model Stock Purchase Agreement - an important collaborative work.  The others provide a range of ideas about the scope and issues.  You will see that Waiver is adjacent to Amendment, and can also be thought of as Delay and Omission.
