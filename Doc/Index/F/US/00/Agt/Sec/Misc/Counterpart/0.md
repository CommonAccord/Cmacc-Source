Note="Counterparts" deals with the formalities of signature.  In paper based transacting, the two parties might sign separate copies of the agreement, such that no copy has all of the signatures.  This issue is expanded with electronic signature, faxes and the like.  The Counterpart section needs reworking for P2P transacting systems.  For background, see, for instance <a href="https://www.contractstandards.com/clauses/counterparts">https://www.contractstandards.com/clauses/counterparts</a>
