Note="Sec" is short for Section.  We treat all sections, subsections and articles as Sec.  Easy to remember and easy to nest.  We mostly try to name Secs by a common set of names - short and mostly based on verb roots.  In our experience, that allows pithy expressiveness.  Sometimes we haven't (yet) found a good verb root, so we use something else.
