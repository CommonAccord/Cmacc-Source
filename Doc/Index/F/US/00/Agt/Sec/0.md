Note="Sec" is short for Section.  We treat all sections, subsections and articles as Sec.  Easy to remember and easy to nest.  We mostly try to name Secs by a common set of names - and try to have many of them be short and based on verb roots.  In our experience, that allows pithy expressiveness.  Sometimes, we haven't found a good verb root and have to use something else.
