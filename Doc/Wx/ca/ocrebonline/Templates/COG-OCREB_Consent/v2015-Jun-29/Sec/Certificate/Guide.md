Ti=PART II: Certificate of Consent

0.sec=This section should be written in the first person and have a statement similar to the one in bold below. If the participant is illiterate but gives oral consent, a witness must sign. A researcher or the person going over the informed consent must sign each consent. The certificate of consent should avoid statements that have "I understandâ€¦." phrases. The understanding should perhaps be better tested through targeted questions during the reading of the information sheet (some examples of questions are given above), or through the questions being asked at the end of the reading of the information sheet, if the potential participant is reading the information sheet him/herself.  

0.sec=I have read the foregoing information, or it has been read to me. I have had the opportunity to ask questions about it and any questions that I have asked have been answered to my satisfaction.  I consent voluntarily to participate as a participant in this research.
