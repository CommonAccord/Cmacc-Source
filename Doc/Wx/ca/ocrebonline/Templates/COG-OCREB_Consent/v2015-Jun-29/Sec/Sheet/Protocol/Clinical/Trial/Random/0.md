Note=involving randomization or blinding

1.sec=Because we do not know if the new malaria drug is better than the currently available drug for treating malaria, we need to compare the two. To do this, we will put people taking part in this research into two groups.  The groups are selected by chance, as if by tossing a coin. 

2.sec=Participants in one group will be given the test drug while participants in the other group will be given the drug that is currently being used for malaria. It is important that neither you nor we know which of the two drugs you are given. This information will be in our files, but we will not look at these files until after the research is finished. This is the best way we have for testing without being influenced by what we think or hope might happen. We will then compare which of the two has the best results.

3.sec=The healthcare workers will be looking after you and the other participants very carefully  during the study.  If we are concerned about what the drug is doing , we will find out which drug you are getting and make changes. If there is anything you are concerned about or that is bothering you about the research please talk to me or one of the other researchers
