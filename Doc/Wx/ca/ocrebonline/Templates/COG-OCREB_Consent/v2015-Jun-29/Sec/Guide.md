Ti=Procedures and Protocol

0.sec=Describe or explain the exact procedures that will be followed on a step-by-step basis, the tests that will be done, and  any drugs that will be given. Explain from the outset what some of the more unfamiliar procedures involve (placebo, randomization, biopsy, etc.) Indicate which procedure is routine and which is experimental or research. Participants should know what to expect and what is expected of them. Use active, rather than conditional, language.

0.sec=Write "we will ask you to…." instead of "we would like to ask you to….". 

In this template, this section has been divided into two: firstly, an explanation of unfamiliar procedures and, secondly,  a description of process. 

1.Ti=Unfamiliar Procedures

This section should be included if there may be procedures which are not familiar to the participant. 

Protocol.Process.Clinical.Trial.0.sec=If the protocol is for a clinical trial:

Protocol.Process.Clinical.Trial.Alt1.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Process/Clinical/Trial/0.md]

Protocol.Process.Clinical.Trial.Alt2.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Process/Clinical/Research/0.md]

Protocol.Process.Clinical.Trial.=[Z/Alt/2]

1.Sec={Protocol.Process.Clinical.Trial.Sec}

2.Ti=Description of the Process

2.0.sec=Describe to the participant what will happen on a step-by-step basis. It may be helpful to the participant if you use drawings or props to better illustrate the procedures. A small vial or container with a little water in it is one way of showing how much blood will be withdrawn. 

(Example:

2.Ti=Description of the Process

Intro.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Intro/0.md]

2.1.Ti=Duration 

2.1.sec=Include a statement about the time commitments of the research for the participant including both the duration of the research and follow-up, if relevant.

Duration.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Duration/0.md]

 (Example:

➢	Examples of question to elucidate understanding: Can you tell me if you remember the number of times that we are asking you  to come to the hospital to complete the treatment? The research project? How many injections will you be given? How many tablets? How much blood will be taken from your veins, using a syringe and needle? Over how many weeks? Etc. Do you have any other questions? Do you want me to go through the procedures again?

2.2.Ti=Side Effects

2.2.sec=Potential participants should be told if there are any known or anticipated side effects and what will happen in the event of a side effect or an unexpected event. 

 (Example:

SideEffect.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/SideEffect/0.md]

2.3.Ti=Risks

2.3.sec=Explain and describe any possible or anticipated  risks. Describe the level of care that will be available in the event that harm does occur, who will provide it, and who will pay for it. A risk can be thought of as being the possibility that harm may occur.  Provide enough information about the risks that the participant can make an informed decision.

(Example:

Risk.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Risk/0.md]

➢	Examples of question to elucidate understanding: Do you understand that, while the research study is on-going, no-one may know which medicine you re receiving? Do you know that the medicine that we are testing  is a new medicine, and we do not know everything about it? Do you understand that you may have some unwanted side-effects from the medicines? Do you understand that these side-effects can happen whether or not you are in the research study? Etc. Do you have any other questions?

2.4.Ti=Benefits 

2.4.sec=Mention only those activities that will be actual benefits and not those to which they are entitled regardless of participation. Benefits may be divided into benefits to the individual, benefits to the community in which the individual resides, and benefits to society as a whole as a result of finding an answer to the research question.

(Example:

Benefit.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Benefit/0.md]

2.5.Ti=Reimbursements

2.5.sec=State clearly what you will provide the participants with as a result of their participation. WHO does not encourage incentives. However, it recommends that reimbursements for expenses incurred as a result of participation in the research be provided. These may include, for example, travel costs and money for wages lost due to visits to health facilities. The amount should be determined within the host country context.

(Example:.

Reimbursement.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Reimbursement/0.md]

➢	Examples of question to elucidate understanding: Can you tell me if you have understood correctly the benefits that you will have if you take part in the study? Do you know if the study will pay for your travel costs and time lost, and do you know how much you will be re-imbursed? Do you have any other questions?
 
2.6.Ti=Confidentiality

2.6.sec=Explain how the research team will maintain the confidentiality of data, especially with respect to the information about the participant which would otherwise be known only to the physician but would now be available to the entire research team. Note that because something out of the ordinary is being done through research, any individual taking part in the research is likely to be more easily identified by members of the community and is therefore more likely to be stigmatized.

(Example:

Confidentiality.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Confidentiality/0.md]

➢	Example of question to elucidate understanding: Did you understand the procedures that we will be using to make sure that any information that we as researchers collect about you will remain confidential? Do you have any questions about them?  

2.7.Ti=Sharing the Results

2.7.sec=Where it is relevant, your plan for sharing the information with the participants should be provided. If  you have a plan and a timeline for the sharing of information, include the details. You should also inform the participant that the research findings will be shared more broadly, for example, through publications and conferences. 

(Example:

ShareResult.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/ShareResult/0.md]

2.8.Ti=Right to Refuse or Withdraw

2.8.sec=This is a reconfirmation that participation is voluntary and includes the right to withdraw. Tailor this section to ensure that it fits for the group for whom you are seeking consent. The example used here is for a patient at a clinic.

(Example:

InClinic.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/InClinic/0.md]

OR
(Example:

NotInClinic.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/NotInClinic/0.md]

2.9.Ti=Alternatives to Participating

2.9.sec=Include this section only if the study involves administration of investigational drugs or use of new therapeutic procedures. It is important to explain and describe the established standard treatment.

 (Example:

Alternative.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Alternative/0.md]


2.10.Ti=Who to Contact

2.10.sec=Provide the name and contact information of someone who is involved, informed and accessible (a local person who can actually be contacted. State also that the proposal has been approved and how. 

(Example:

Contact.=[Wx/ca/ocrebonline/Templates/COG-OCREB_Consent/v2015-Jun-29/Sec/Protocol/Contact/0.md]

➢	Example of question to elucidate understanding: Do you know that you do not have to take part in this study if you do not wish to? You can say No if you wish to? Do you know that you can ask me questions later, if you wish to? Do you know that I have given the contact details of the person who can give you more information about the study? Etc.

00.sec=You can ask me any more questions about any part of the research study, if you wish to. Do you have any questions?
