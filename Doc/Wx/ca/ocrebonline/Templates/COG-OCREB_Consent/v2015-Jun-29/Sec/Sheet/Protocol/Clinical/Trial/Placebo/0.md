1.sec=A placebo or inactive medicine looks like real medicine but it is not. 

2.sec=It is a dummy or pretend medicine. It has no effect on a person because it has no real medicine in it. 

3.sec=Sometimes when we want  to know whether a new medicine is good, we give some people the new medicine and some people the pretend or  dummy medicine. 

4.sec=For the research to be good, it is important that you do not  know whether you have been given the real medicine or  the pretend or dummy medicine.

5.sec=This is one of the best ways we have for knowing what the medicine we are testing really does.
