Ti=Information on the Trial Drug {Study.Drug.New.Name.Full}

1.sec=The drug we are testing in this research is called {Study.Drug.New.Name.Full}. It has been tested  before with people who do not have malaria but who live in areas where malaria is common. We now want to test the drug on people who have malaria. This second research is called a "phase 2" trial. 

2.sec=The drug {Study.Drug.New.Name.Full} is made by {Study.Drug.New.Maker.Name.Full}.  You should know that it has a few side effects. One of the side effects, or problems, is that you may feel tired for the first day after being given the drug. Also, 20% of the people who tried the drug in previous research experienced temporary swelling where the injection entered the skin. We know of no other problem or risks.

3.sec=Some participants in the research will not be given the drug which we are testing. Instead, they will be given the drug {Study.Drug.Old.Name.Full}, the drug which is most commonly used in this region to treat malaria. There is no risk associated with that drug and no known problems. It does not, however, cure malaria as often as we would like.
