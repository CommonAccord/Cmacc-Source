Ti=PART I: Information Sheet

1.Ti=Introduction

1.sec=Briefly state who you are and explain that you are inviting them to participate in the research you are doing. Inform them that they may talk to anyone they feel comfortable talking with about the research  and that they can take time to reflect on whether they want to participate or not. Assure the participant that if they do not understand some of the words or concepts, that you will take time to explain them as you go along and that they can ask questions now or later.

2.Ti=Purpose of the research

2.sec=Explain in lay terms why  you are doing the research. The language used should clarify rather than confuse. Use local and simplified terms for a disease, e.g. local name of disease instead of malaria, mosquito instead of anopheles, “mosquitoes help in spreading the disease” rather than “mosquitoes are the vectors”. Avoid using terms like pathogenesis, indicators, determinants, equitable etc. There  are guides on the internet to help you find substitutes for words which are overly scientific or are professional jargon.

3.Ti=Type of Research Intervention

3.sec=Briefly state the type of  intervention that will be undertaken. This will be expanded upon in the procedures section but it may be helpful and less confusing to the participant if  they know from the very beginning whether, for example,  the research involves a vaccine, an interview, a biopsy or a series of finger pricks. 

(Example:

3.sec=This research will involve a single injection in your arm as well as four follow-up visits to the clinic.

4.Ti=Participant selection

4.sec=State why this participant has been chosen for this research.  People often wonder why they have been chosen to participate and may be fearful, confused or concerned.

➢	 Example of question to elucidate understanding: Do you know why we are asking you to take part in this study? Do you know what the study is about?

5.Ti=Voluntary Participation

5.sec=Indicate clearly that they can choose to participate or not. State, what the alternative  - in terms of the treatment offered by the clinic - will be, if they decide not to participate. State, only if it is applicable, that they will still receive all the services they usually do whether they choose to participate or not. This can be repeated and expanded upon later in the form as well, but it is important to state clearly at the beginning of the form that participation is voluntary so that the other information can be heard in this context.

➢	Examples of question to elucidate understanding: If you decide not to take part in this research study, do you know what your options are? Do you know that you do not have to take part in this research study, if you do not wish to? Do you have any questions?

Include the following section only if the protocol is for a clinical trial:

6.Ti=Information on the Trial Drug {Study.Drug.New.Name.Full}

6.1.sec=give the phase of the trial and explain what that means. Explain to the participant why you are comparing or testing the drugs. 

6.2.sec=provide as much information as is appropriate and understandable about the drug such as its manufacturer or location of manufacture and the reason for its development. 

6.3.sec=explain the known experience with this drug

6.4.sec=explain comprehensively all the known side-effects/toxicity of this drug, as well as the adverse effects of all the other  medicines that are being used in the trial
