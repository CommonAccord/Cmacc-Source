Ti=Use of Funds from 100 and Change:

1.sec=To fund a "Center for Decentralized Law" - tentatively based in Cambridge, MA.  

2.0.sec=The CDL will:

2.1.sec=Act as a center for needs analysis and technology interface.

2.2.0.sec=Fund similar centers ("hubs") in other jurisdictions, including:

2.2.1.sec=an international hub for law in Europe;

2.2.2.sec=national law hubs in as many countries as appropriately organize one; and

2.2.3.sec=hubs in as many of the US states as appropriately organize one.

2.2.=[Z/ol/s3]

2.3.0.sec=Pay a small administrative staff, whose principal duties will be:

2.3.1.sec=administration of the proposal process;

2.3.2.sec=diplomacy among the hubs and with other stakeholders; and

2.3.3.sec=interface to technical standards groups.

2.3.=[Z/ol/s3]

2.=[Z/ol/s3]

3.sec=Each of the hubs will be affiliated with appropriate institutions, for instance law schools.  Each hub's overhead will be independently funded. Hubs will not receive overhead funds from the 100&C grant.  Hubs will act as pass-throughs for proposals from third parties. E.g., hubs will forward project proposals from third parties to the CDL, with recommendations, for decision by the CDL.

4.sec=It is anticipated that other similar projects will develop, based on trade groups, publishers, or governments.  These are welcomed and such other groups are free to use or contribute.  They will not be eligible for direct funding, but may collaborate with the hubs.
