Much of "the law" is a set of naming conventions for shared ideas. So is the web.<br>

   The top level expressed here is:<ul><li>

"G" is for Prose Objects.  They are maintained in git, hence the "G". This is now where all our energy is going.<li>

 "GH" is for GitHub repos.  "GHx" represents GitHub repos that we have imagined.<li>

  "P" is reserved for your private, preferred, proprietary materials.  You will want some place to keep your private forms, clauses, instructions, etc.<li>

  "S" for some shared materials, stuff thought common and explanatory.<li>

"U" means something like "you" and has info about persons and places.<li>

"W" is intended to denote a www. website.  "Wx" because not official.<li>

"Z" is little bits of infrastructure text.<li>

"ipfs" is experiments with the IPFS hashed text files.<li>

"zFact" is a parking place for "facts" currently just a taxonomy of "FHIR" medical record codes. 

</ul>

A place to start might be: <a href="index.php?action=list&file=G/">G/</a>.
