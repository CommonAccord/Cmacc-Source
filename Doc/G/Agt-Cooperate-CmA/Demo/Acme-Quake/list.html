First the parties make a "Connect" document which has basic information about them and makes some choices. Then they make a "Cooperation Agreement" by which they adopt IACCM Principles as aspirations and make binding agreements regarding dispute  resolution, notices and similar good-housekeeping.  Then they enter into a mutual NDA for discussions.  Then Acme engages Quake under a Consulting Agreement.  In each of these steps, the parties build on prior agreements.

The Consulting Agreement has an "Entire Agreement" section which expressly deals with this and transcludes the names and dates of the other agreements.
