The NDA is like the Cooperation Agreement, but now the Confidentiality provisions are full-blown and presented in the "Focus" of the document, in Section 1.  (Click "Document" to see the full text.  Follow -NDA/-Mutual/ to see the libraries that structure the document.) (Note that the cross-references continue to work even as the section has been moved. This is because sections are included and referenced by meaning rather than by position.)
