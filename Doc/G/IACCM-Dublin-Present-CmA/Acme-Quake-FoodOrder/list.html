This shows a flow of a restaurant ordering from a supplier. The restaurant completes a PO, the parties add a micro agreement, and incorporate an Annex of standard terms. <br>

So the flow is:<ul><li>Step1.  PO

<li>Step 2. Micro-Master Services Agreement

<li>Step3. Annex for industry standards -> that configures a broad standard agreement.</ul>
