Note special to the Source.CommonAccord.Org presentation:

<br>

This version is <i>copied</i> from <a href="http://github.com/CommonAccord/Form-Agt/">github.com/CommonAccord/Form-Agt/</a>.  It <u>should</u> be synced via git from there.  Using submodules, that works locally, but it of course does not sync back up to /CommonAccord/Cmacc-Source/, so does not appear in the website source.commonaccord.org.  I presume that there is a way to square this circle, but need some help (with git)?
