(v).sec=use, operation, repair or installation by the {_Customer} in a manner which does not comply with the Specification, {_Agreement} and/or {_Documentation}; 
(vi).sec=repair or modification by the {_Customer}, or a third party without prior written authorization from the {_Manufacturer}; and
(vii).sec=beta, evaluation, or other testing versions of the {_Products}.
The warranties set out in this Clause 13 ({_Manufacturer} Warranties) shall constitute the sole warranty and sole remedy for the {_Customer} and the sole liability of the {_Manufacturer} with respect thereto. The warranties in this clause are in lieu of all other warranties, express or implied.  Additionally, the warranties set forth herein only apply when notice of a warranty claim is provided to {_Manufacturer} within the applicable warranty period specified herein and do not apply to any bug, defect or error caused by or attributable to software or hardware not supplied by {_Manufacturer}.
(b).sec=Except for the warranties expressly set forth in this section 13 and in appendix 4, the software, equipment, and/or all services are provided “as is”, and {_Manufacturer} and its suppliers provide no other warranties of any kind, express or implied with regard to the same.

To the extent an implied warranty cannot be excluded, such warranty is limited in duration to the express warranty period.  Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, the above limitation may not apply.  Further, {_Manufacturer} and its suppliers do not warrant the results of use of the {_Software} or that the {_Software} is bug/error free or that its use will be uninterrupted. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this {_Agreement}. In addition, due to continual development of new techniques for intruding upon/attacking mobile devices and software, {_Manufacturer} does not warrant that the {_Software} or any equipment, system, or network on which the {_Software} is used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or attack.  {_Manufacturer} does not warrant that any services connecting to the {_Software} provided by third parties or any data provided by such third parties will be free from errors or interruptions of service.

15.5	{_Software} Features and Functionality. If the {_Manufacturer} in any updates deletes features or functionality from any {_Manufacturer}-developed {_Supported_Software} without replacing it with the same or better and transfers the same to another product, the portion of the other product that contains the features or functionality in question, or the entire product, if such features and functionality cannot be separated out, will be provided, if and when available, at no additional license fee under the following conditions:  (1) {_Customer} is a current maintenance paying customer for the {_Software} licensed herein  ; (2) {_Customer} is not in breach of any terms of this {_Agreement}; (3) the new product to which the functions have been transferred  has no more differences in price, features, and functionality from the {_Customer}'s current version of {_Software}; (4) {_Customer} relinquishes all rights to use previous versions of the {_Software} following a reasonable, mutually agreed,  transition; and (5) {_Customer} pays any additional third party charges associated with the software, if any.
