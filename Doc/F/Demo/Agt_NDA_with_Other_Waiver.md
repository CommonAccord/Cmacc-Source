Note=Mix and match.  In this example, the CooleyGo version of a Waiver section is replaced by the ABA MSPA version of a Waiver section.  We reference a general library of terms, then override the Misc.Waive.Sec with the MSPA version and replace the MSPA's defined terms with ones appropriate for the NDA.
