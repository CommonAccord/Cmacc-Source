Note=Mix and match.  In this example, the CooleyGo version of a Waiver section is replaced by the ABA MSPA version of a Waiver section.  We reference a general library of terms, then override the Misc.Waive.Sec with Misc.Waive.MSPA.Sec.  In the ABA Miscellaneous section, we replace the defined terms with ones appropriate for the NDA.
