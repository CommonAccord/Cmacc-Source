YCombinator "SAFE" notes.  YCombinator published four variants.  These four are "refactored" here: the most complex of them, the Note with a Cap and a Discount, is used as a base for the other three.  The others consist of a set of changes and a link to the Cap and Discount note.<br>

  Here, we give four uses, of the four forms, all based on a single deal point list.  Again, the deal point list (in effect, its term sheet) is based on the most complex, the Cap and Discount.  The variations are made by linking to that, and linking to the desired form - where the link to the desired form appears first, and therefore has higher priority. (If there are defaults in the form, or overrides in the deal point list, this will not give the right result - you will have to make a copy of the deal points list.  But it works here and makes a point about working with objects.)
