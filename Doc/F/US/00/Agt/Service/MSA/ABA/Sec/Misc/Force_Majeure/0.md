1.Ti=Definition

1.sec=Subject to {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Use of Alternate Providers by Customer) below, neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any Statement of Work, if any, to the extent such failure or delay both: (a) is caused, without fault of the non-performing Party, by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature, or acts of God; acts of war, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions; quarantines, embargoes, and other similar governmental action; or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party; and (b) could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions and cannot reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, work-around plans or other means.

2.Ti=Excused Performance

2.sec=Events meeting both of the criteria set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of  {ForceMajeure.Xref}.1 (Definition) above are referred to collectively as “Force Majeure Events”. Subject to {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Use of Alternate Providers by Customer) below, upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the non-performing Party shall be excused from its non-performance or observance of the affected obligation(s) for as long as such circumstances prevail and such Party continues to attempt to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay. Any Party so delayed in its performance will immediately notify the other by telephone or by the most timely means otherwise available (to be confirmed in writing within two (2) business days of the inception of such delay) and describe in reasonable detail the circumstances causing such delay.

3.Ti=Use of Alternate Providers by Customer

3.sec=If a Force Majeure Event causes a material failure or delay in the performance of any Services for more than five (5) consecutive days, Customer shall have the right, at its sole election, and in addition to any rights Customer may have pursuant to {Life.TerminateForceMajeure.Xref-8.3} (Termination for Force Majeure), procure such Services from an alternate source until Service Provider is again able to provide such Services. Customer shall continue to pay Service Provider the applicable fees for Services actually rendered by Service Provider, less any amounts payable by Customer to the alternate source, but Service Provider shall not be entitled to any additional payments as a result of the Force Majeure Event. Notwithstanding any other provision of this {ForceMajeure.Xref}.3 (Force Majeure), a Force Majeure Event shall not relieve Service Provider of its obligation to implement successfully all of the Services relating to disaster recovery and business continuity services that are included in any Statement of Work within the time period described in such Statement of Work.

4.Ti=Allocation of Resources

4.sec=Without limiting Service Provider’s obligations under this Agreement, whenever a Force Majeure Event causes Service Provider to allocate limited resources between or among Service Provider’s customers, Customer shall receive at least the same treatment as comparable Service Provider customer. In no event will Service Provider redeploy or reassign any Service Provider Personnel to another customer or account in the event of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event without the prior written consent of Customer, which consent may be withheld in Customer’s sole discretion.
