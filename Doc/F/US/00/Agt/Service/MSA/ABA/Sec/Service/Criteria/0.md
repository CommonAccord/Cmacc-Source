sec=Service Provider shall perform the Services in a manner that shall: (a) avoid any adverse impact on the business, operations, financial condition and/or prospects of Customer; and (b) not degrade the services then being received by Customer from other Third Parties or provided internally by Customer. Prior to undertaking any Services-related activity or task, Service Provider shall discuss with Customer all known material risks and shall not proceed with such activity or task until Customer is satisfied with the plans with regard to such risks (provided, however, that, neither Service Provider’s disclosure of any such risks to Customer, nor Customer acquiescence in Service Provider’s plans, shall operate or be construed as limiting Service Provider’s responsibilities under this Agreement). Service Provider shall identify and resolve any problems that may impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the SOW that is Service Provider’s responsibility and shall use its best efforts to assist Customer with the resolution of any problems that may impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the SOW that is Customer’s responsibility.
