Ti=Change Order Procedures

1.Ti=Change Request

1.sec=If either Party believes that a change (whether in the processes, procedures, standards, Service Levels, time frames, costs or deliverables) is necessary or desirable, such Party shall submit a written change request to the other Party (a “Change Request”). Service Provider represents to Customer that it has factored into Service Provider’s fee adequate contingencies for de minimis change orders. Accordingly, if Change Requests are made, they will be presumed not to impact the fees under this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Change Request consists of other than a de minimis deviation from the scope of the SOW, Service Provider shall provide Customer with written notification of such other deviation within {SOW.ChangeOrder.ProviderNoticeOfNonDeMinimis.Within.cl} after receipt of the Change Request.

2.Ti=Change Response

2.sec=In the event of a Customer-initiated Change Request, within {SOW.ChangeOrder.ProviderNoticeOfImpact.Within.cl} of Service Provider’s receipt of such Change Request, Service Provider shall provide to Customer a written statement describing in detail: (a) the impact on any Customer System performance, if any, and the modifications to the Customer System that will be required as a result of the Change Request including changes in Services and/or Deliverables; (b) the effect of the Change Request on the applicable SOW plans and tasks including any impact on any Critical Path Milestone dates; and (c) an estimate of the cost to implement each Change Request (collectively, the “Change Response”). If Service Provider submits a Change Request to Customer, such Change Request shall include the information required for a Change Response. Customer shall accept or reject any Change Response or Service Provider-initiated Change Request, as applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt of same from Service Provider.

3.Ti=Change Order

3.sec=If Customer accepts a Change Response or Service Provider-initiated Change Request in writing, such Change Response, together with Customer’s Change Request, or such Service Provider-initiated Change Request, shall be deemed to be a “Change Order” and shall become part of this Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work. If Customer rejects Service Provider’s Change Response or Service Provider-initiated Change Request, Service Provider shall proceed to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work. Without first obtaining Customer’s prior written approval in accordance with the Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (Change Order Procedures), which approval Customer may withhold in its sole discretion, Service Provider shall make no Change which may: (a) increase Customer’s total cost of the Services and/or Deliverables; (b) require changes to Customer’s Systems, facilities, software, utilities, tools or equipment; (c) require Customer to install a new version, release, upgrade of, or replacement for, any software or equipment or to modify any software or equipment; (d) have an adverse impact on the functionality, interoperability, performance, security, accuracy, speed, responsiveness, quality, or resource efficiency of the Services and/or Deliverables; (e) have an adverse impact on the schedule for and the delivery of services and/or products by Customer to its clients and customers; or (f) violate or be inconsistent with the Customer Policies and/or applicable Laws.
