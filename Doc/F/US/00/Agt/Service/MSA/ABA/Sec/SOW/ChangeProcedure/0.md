Ti=Change Order Procedures

1.Ti=Change Request

1.sec=If either Party believes that a change (whether in the processes, procedures, standards, Service Levels, time frames, costs or deliverables) is necessary or desirable, such Party shall submit a written change request to the other Party (a “Change Request”). {_Vendor} represents to {_Client} that it has factored into {_Vendor}’s fee adequate contingencies for de minimis change orders. Accordingly, if Change Requests are made, they will be presumed not to impact the fees under this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Change Request consists of other than a de minimis deviation from the scope of the SOW, {_Vendor} shall provide {_Client} with written notification of such other deviation within {SOW.ChangeOrder.VendorNoticeOfNonDeMinimis.Within.cl} after receipt of the Change Request.

2.Ti=Change Response

2.sec=In the event of a {_Client}-initiated Change Request, within {SOW.ChangeOrder.VendorNoticeOfImpact.Within.cl} of {_Vendor}’s receipt of such Change Request, {_Vendor} shall provide to {_Client} a written statement describing in detail: (a) the impact on any {_Client} System performance, if any, and the modifications to the {_Client} System that will be required as a result of the Change Request including changes in Services and/or Deliverables; (b) the effect of the Change Request on the applicable SOW plans and tasks including any impact on any Critical Path Milestone dates; and (c) an estimate of the cost to implement each Change Request (collectively, the “Change Response”). If {_Vendor} submits a Change Request to {_Client}, such Change Request shall include the information required for a Change Response. {_Client} shall accept or reject any Change Response or {_Vendor}-initiated Change Request, as applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt of same from {_Vendor}.

3.Ti=Change Order

3.sec=If {_Client} accepts a Change Response or {_Vendor}-initiated Change Request in writing, such Change Response, together with {_Client}’s Change Request, or such {_Vendor}-initiated Change Request, shall be deemed to be a “Change Order” and shall become part of this Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work. If {_Client} rejects {_Vendor}’s Change Response or {_Vendor}-initiated Change Request, {_Vendor} shall proceed to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Statement of Work. Without first obtaining {_Client}’s prior written approval in accordance with the Change Order procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 (Change Order Procedures), which approval {_Client} may withhold in its sole discretion, {_Vendor} shall make no Change which may: (a) increase {_Client}’s total cost of the Services and/or Deliverables; (b) require changes to {_Client}’s Systems, facilities, software, utilities, tools or equipment; (c) require {_Client} to install a new version, release, upgrade of, or replacement for, any software or equipment or to modify any software or equipment; (d) have an adverse impact on the functionality, interoperability, performance, security, accuracy, speed, responsiveness, quality, or resource efficiency of the Services and/or Deliverables; (e) have an adverse impact on the schedule for and the delivery of services and/or products by {_Client} to its clients and customers; or (f) violate or be inconsistent with the {_Client} Policies and/or applicable Laws.
