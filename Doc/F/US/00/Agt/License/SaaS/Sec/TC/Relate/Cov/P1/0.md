Ti=Restrictions and Responsibilities

1.sec={_Customer} will not, directly or indirectly: reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms relevant to {_Services} or any software, documentation or data related to {_Services} ("{_Software}"); modify, translate, or create derivative works based on {_Services} or any {_Software} (except to the extent expressly permitted by {_Company} or authorized within {_Services}); use {_Services} or any {_Software} for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third; or remove any proprietary notices or labels.  With respect to any {_Software} that is distributed or provided to {_Customer} for use on {_Customer} premises or devices, {_Company} hereby grants {_Customer} a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use such {_Software} during the Term only in connection with {_Services}.

/Note=OPTIONAL: if there is no distributed software, this clause can be deleted. (this means above)

2.sec=Further, {_Customer} may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of {_Services}, {_Software} or anything related thereto, or any direct product thereof in violation of any restrictions, laws or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.  As defined in FAR section 2.101, {_Software} and documentation are "commercial items" and according to DFAR section 252.227 7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation."  Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of {_this_Agreement} and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of {_this_Agreement}.

Note=export and government rights clauses are typically less important for pure hosted solutions, but there are still some potential triggers with certain kinds of technical information (and if there is any client-side code).

3.1.sec={_Customer} represents, covenants, and warrants that {_Customer} will use {_Services} only in compliance with {_Company}'s standard published policies then in effect ("{_Policy}") and all applicable laws and regulations.

3.2.sec={_Customer} hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless {_Company} against any damages, losses, liabilities, settlements and expenses (including without limitation costs and attorneys' fees) in connection with any claim or action that arises from an alleged violation of the foregoing or otherwise from {_Customer}'s use of {_Services}.

Note=many larger customers resist these types of indemnity clauses.  The decision on whether or not to include this clause may depend on the type of solution and potential commercial risk actually posed by {_Customer}'s usage.

3.3.sec=Although {_Company} has no obligation to monitor {_Customer}'s use of {_Services}, {_Company} may do so and may prohibit any use of {_Services} it believes may be (or alleged to be) in violation of the foregoing.

4.sec={_Customer} shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use {_Services}, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networking, web servers and the like (collectively, "{_Equipment}").  {_Customer} shall also be responsible for maintaining the security of {_Equipment}, {_Customer} account, passwords (including but not limited to administrative and user passwords) and files, and for all uses of {_Customer} account or {_Equipment} with or without {_Customer}'s knowledge or consent.
