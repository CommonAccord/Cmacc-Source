Ti=Amendments and Waivers

1.sec=Any term of {_this_Agreement} may be amended and the observance of any term of {_this_Agreement} may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance, and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of {_the_Company} and the holders of [a majority] of the Registrable Securities then outstanding; provided that {_the_Company} may in its sole discretion waive compliance with Subsection 2.12(c) (and {_the_Company}’s failure to object promptly in writing after notification of a proposed assignment allegedly in violation of Subsection 2.12(c) shall be deemed to be a waiver); and provided further that any provision hereof may be waived by any waiving party on such party’s own behalf, without the consent of any other party.

2.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, {_this_Agreement} may not be amended or terminated and the observance of any term hereof may not be waived with respect to any {_Investor} without the written consent of such {_Investor}, unless such amendment, termination, or waiver applies to all {_Investors} in the same fashion (it being agreed that a waiver of the provisions of Section 4 with respect to a particular transaction shall be deemed to apply to all {_Investors} in the same fashion if such waiver does so by its terms, notwithstanding the fact that certain {_Investors} may nonetheless, by agreement with {_the_Company}, purchase securities in such transaction).

Note=3.sec is optional

3.sec=Further, {_this_Agreement} may not be amended, and no provision hereof may be waived, in each case, in any way which would adversely affect the rights of the Key Holders hereunder in a manner disproportionate to any adverse effect such amendment or waiver would have on the rights of the {_Investors} hereunder, without also the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities held by the Key Holders.

4.sec={_The_Company} shall give prompt notice of any amendment or termination hereof or waiver hereunder to any party hereto that did not consent in writing to such amendment, termination, or waiver.

5.sec=Any amendment, termination, or waiver effected in accordance with this {Xref} shall be binding on all parties hereto, regardless of whether any such party has consented thereto.  No waivers of or exceptions to any term, condition, or provision of {_this_Agreement}, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such term, condition, or provision.
