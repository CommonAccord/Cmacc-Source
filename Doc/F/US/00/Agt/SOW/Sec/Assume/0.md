Ti=Assumptions

0.sec=Project Assumptions are those expectations upon which the Project “path forward” is based and which, if proven incor-rect, result in a significant Project Issue that could invalidate the Project Budget Estimates, Schedules, and Approach. Such an invalidated Project Assumption will usually result in processing of a Change Request to the Project.
